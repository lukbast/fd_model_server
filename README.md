# fd_model_server

This repo is part of [Food Detector](https://github.com/lukbast/food-detector) project. 
It contains Dockerfile for creating Docker image of Tensorflow [Serving](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/serving) bundled with model trained by me. 
There's no much to say about this simple repo.
